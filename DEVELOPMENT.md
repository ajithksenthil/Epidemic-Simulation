# Development
    Week 1: I have added code to model the population as it changes overtime. I tried to add
                different libraries, running into issues with the cmake file to include a graph plotting library.
                
    Day: 4/22/2020: Linked the external file to github and used the correct repository.
    
    Week 2: goal is to produce a basic simulation of an epidemic and reproduce a graph.
    Day: 4/23/2020: experimented with the stacked bar graphs.
    Day: 4/25/2020: Fixed the code for the infection simulation.
    Day: 4/26/2020: Connected the code for the simulation to producing a graph and debugged.
    Day: 4/27/2020: Experimented with different transition values for the simulation.
    
    Week 3: goal is to add vaccines, to add command line interface, and to create dynamic people and containers.
    Day: 4/30/2020: added vaccinations
    Day: 5/1/2020: added command line interface
    Day: 5/2/2020: added dynamic person objects and enclosed container
    Day: 5/3/2020: Debugged code
    Day: 5/5/2020: Cleaned up code adding better documentation, need to resolve github push error.
