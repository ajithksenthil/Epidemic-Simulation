# Infection Prediction: An SIR Model Epidemic Simulator
**Author**: Ajith Senthil

Overview

Infection Prediction is a sophisticated epidemic simulation tool that employs the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to analyze and predict the spread of infectious diseases. This project encapsulates the intricate behaviors of disease transmission, offering a simulated environment that mirrors real-world scenarios of epidemics.

Key Features

Dynamic SIR Modelling: Simulates the three critical variables of epidemic modeling: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), and Recovered (R) or deceased individuals.
Transition Rate Analysis: Calculates the rate of change between the SIR variables over time, providing insights into the disease's progression.
Visualization Tools: Utilizes libraries like CairoBasic, matplotlib-cpp, and VboMesh to generate informative graphs.
User Interactivity: Allows modification of external variables such as vaccination rates and public health interventions to observe their impact on the epidemic's trajectory.
Real-Time Simulation: Aims to include a GUI that shows the interactions between individual agents and the effects of environmental changes.
